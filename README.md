# How to Play ClashRoom

A real-time, multiplayer bingo game for lectures.

## 1. Overview
ClashRoom is a multiplayer web game where each player receives a unique bingo card filled with common lecture scenarios. As the lecture happens in real time, players mark off squares when the corresponding scenario occurs. Get a full row or column before your opponent to win!

## 2. Getting Started
- Join an existing game or create a new one.
- Once both players are connected, each receives a randomly generated bingo card.
- **Do not refresh or leave the page during a game**—your card may be lost.

## 3. How to Play
1. Watch the lecture.
2. Each square describes a scenario (e.g., “Professor goes off-topic,” “Someone asks to repeat the slide,” “Technical issue occurs”).
3. Tap or click a square to mark it **only when the scenario has actually happened**.

## 4. Winning the Game
You win by completing:
- A full row  
- A full column
- A full Diagonal

When a player completes one, the game immediately ends and the winner is declared.

## 5. Fair Play & Etiquette
- Only mark squares for events that genuinely occur during the lecture.
- Don’t reveal your card to the other player unless you want to.
- If a disputed event happens, rely on player honesty—Lecture Bingo is meant to be fun, not competitive.

## 6. End of Game
- Start a new round with fresh random cards.
- Return to the main menu.
